##  do ALL this ONLY AFTER webmin since webmin seems to be very "picky" as to what version it is willing to accept.
## or php upgrade to 7.4 AFTER webmin install??  (could be dangerous)

2021-07-18 - it appears to be SAFE to upgrade php 7.2 (from virtualmin) to php 7.4
           - also, only test this:
                   echo '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' > phpinfo.php ;
             AFTER installing the first virtualmin VM othewise it appears to fail

###  centos-8:

    dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

2021-08-07 -- dont forget to tar/copy over /usr/lib/local/php !

maybe better to SKIP this section entirely since webmin seems to be very "picky" as to what version it is willing to accept.

centos-8:
dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

to UPDATE from 7.2 (virtualim favorite version) to 7.4:  (2021-06-24)

  dnf  module  reset php    ;
  dnf module enable  php:7.4   ;
  dnf  update  php\*    ;

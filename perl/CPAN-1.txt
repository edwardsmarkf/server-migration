###     installs CPAN 2.18 as of 2020-01-13

###     2020-01-13  -- extracted from perl.bsh into its own module

#### these command need to be ran MANUALLY (could not get tcl-expect to work properly)  (did not bother to get it working properly)

perl -MCPAN -e shell ;     ## click several times, twice at first, then ONCE again after a couple of minutes (updates .bashrc) 
    ##  this need to be done twice...!
cpan ;   ## run once for initialize and testing, hit return over and over

perl -MCPAN -e shell ;   #run once for initialization and testing 
perl -MCPAN -e shell  'o conf prerequisites_policy follow;  '   ;
perl -MCPAN -e shell  'o conf commit'      ;

/usr/bin/cpan   ;  ## 2021-06-25
   install CPAN
   reload CPAN
   
## if the "install CPAN" takes forever, it might be because of an internal issue with IPV6 that hast to be resolved with the web hosting company!

/usr/bin/cpan    -i   -f  Template::Stash::XS      ;             ## prompts for *TWO* "y" replies (?)

perl -e  'use Template::Stash::XS ; '   ;      ## TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST ! !
